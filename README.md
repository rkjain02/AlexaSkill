# AlexaSkill
This is an Alexa skill which lets users play a voice-controlled version of the infamous interactive math game known to programmers everywhere as Fizz Buzz. The rules are pretty simple Alexa and the user take turns counting up with Alexa starting with one. If the number is divisble by 3 it should be replaced with the word "fizz", if the number is divisble by 5 it should be replaced with the word "buzz", and if the number is divisible by 15 it should be replaced with the word "fizz buzz".
Currently this game is supported in US English and US Spanish locales. 
## Directories
This repository has a Fizz Buzz basic and Fizz Buzz language directory where the language directory supports Spanish as well. Please ignore the practice it includes me tinkering around with some of the Alexa skill concepts. Each of the directories is split into the frontend which includes the voice user interface interaction models and the backend which includes the javascript file.
